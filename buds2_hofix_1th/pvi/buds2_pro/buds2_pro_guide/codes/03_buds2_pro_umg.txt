            Galaxy Buds2 Pro. Recommended by the Pros. “Counting Stars” for sure
            changed the trajectory of our brand. We knew there was a lot riding
            on it and that if we connected globally with something real and
            resonant, that it would last potentially the rest of our lives. Here
            we are ten years later, and I decided to remix the song in a brand
            new way, re-envision it top down in partnership with Samsung Galaxy.
            Disclaimer: Image simulated. Actual UI may differ. Requires
            smartphone pairing via Bluetooth. Galaxy wearable app is compatible
            with smartphones and tablets running Android 8.0 or later and with
            more than 1.5GB of RAM. Galaxy Z Flip5 sold separately. Availability
            of colors and models may vary by country or carrier. Ryan Tedder.
            Producer, Singer, Songwriter. Initially I was intimidated by it, I
            was like getting out of the way of the shadow of that song. And then
            I just listened to it and I was like, okay, first of all, make piano
            the main instrument instead of guitar. Disclaimer: Image simulated.
            Actual UI may differ. The new version is darker, atmospheric and way
            more layers and textures. 24-bit, we’ve been using it for seven
            years, but then you mix a song so it can exist on a streaming
            service and then it gets squashed down into a super low quality
            16-bit. 16-bit audio, it is a limited spectrum, but it’s fine.
            However with 24-bit, you get a much, much more vivid, wider range of
            sounds. The boost in audio between the two is truly significant.
            Mixing 360 audio with Dolby Atmos, allows you to feel music the way
            I intended. How the music is delivered greatly affects the way it’s
            experienced. Of course, it’s going to sound incredible in a state of
            the art music studio, but that means nothing if it doesn’t translate
            to the real world. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro is the bridge between my
            studio and the listener. Disclaimer: 24-bit audio support may vary
            depending on the application. Samsung Galaxy device with One UI
            version 4.0 or higher is required. 360 Audio available only on
            Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets with Android One UI version
            3.1 or later. Image simulated. Actual UI may differ. They allow you
            to experience the music the way I intended to be heard. Making music
            has always been about capturing feeling or emotion. Getting to
            experience it in the most immersive way is absolutely incomparable.
